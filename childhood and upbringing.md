#### Blessings
- grew up in a devoted and Christ centered household
- went to an amazing church
- a christian kindergarten and primary school
- the people in those environments embodied Gods love
- those people set an example

#### Challenges
- rejection
	- it was more like being treated differently because of my condition (adhd)
	- but at my young age it equated to rejection in my head
	- this was in all environments save for a rare few (kids church and art class)

#### Lessons
- primary school principal
	- he chatted to me regularly when i got sent to his office
	- introduced a lot of non specific but really insightful world views
	- he didnt see my traits as flaws but treated them with respect
- kids church teacher
	- she was a primary (or high school i dont actually remember) teacher
	- she showed me unconditional love and was very patient with me
	- this taught me to be more secure with myself and value who i am

#### Growth
- i grew into a young man with Christ centred values and strong understanding of what is right and wrong (though whether or not i followed those values is another thing)
- i learnt that God made me and that im worth more than what people assign to me
- i was still very immature with much to learn but the foundation was set
	- side note, the name of the church i went to actually translates to cornerstone or foundation which i find to be very poetic

	- amazing environments to grow and learn in

	- a strong sense of rejection
