- yap: 30 seconds
- how did Jesus change my life?
	- worked in me continually (emphasis on how God has been so faithful)
	- some scriptures that i live by
		- 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
		  `Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.`
		- Matthew 6:33
		  `But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.`

- what was i like before i took God seriously?
	- unserious
	- ran away from things, even important ones
	- didnt really acknowledge my lust, greed and pride as an issue
	- i was used secular reasoning and failed to see God in the picture

- i started taking God seriously
	- this was about 4-5 years ago? (pretty sure)
	- i hit rock bottom and started looking for answers
	- funny that the answer was there all along
	- i remembered the bits in proverbs that talked about the fools who suffered because they followed their own ways
	- i realised that was me LOL

- why not earlier?
	- i had a warped perception of baptism
		- guilt, shame and not being good enough
		- thinking i wasnt ready
	- commitment and avoidant issues
		- uh lets not talk about this in too much detail :P

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- what changed?
	- met different people that changed my perception of baptism 
		- (some who are strangers!)
		- i realised that what Jesus did on the cross is actually really significant
			- it erased my sins; past, present and future
				- callback to the sins i mentioned earlier
					- im now very critical of my sinful behaviours and thoughts and lean on God when i need help
					- i dont run away from things nearly as much anymore because i know God places things in my path for a reason
					- always remember God when i go about any reasoning
			- he did it for everyone and will be given to anyone who is willing to follow Him and accept His gift
		- what does this mean though?
			- call back to my guilt and shame and not being good enough
			- no im NOT good enough and cant save myself from anything 
			- i realise i have been delivered from my sins because of Jesus' sacrifice
			- call back to my growth
- whats next?
	- follow Gods calling for me to be a "minister of hearts" (prophesied by a stranger, he even prayed for me <3)
		- continue to better myself so i can be prepared to guide and minister others in their faith
	- continue to make effort in LIVING OUT Gods word
		- read the word more
		- pray when tempted or faced with difficulty
- CONCLUSION
	- scripture to end this on
		- Joshua 1:9
		  `Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.`
		- Matthew 28:19
		  `Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,`
