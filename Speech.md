	- id always known Hes always been there (upbringing)
	- worked in me continually (growth cycles)
	- some scriptures that i live by
		- 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
		  `Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.`
		- Matthew 6:33
		  `But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.`
		- Proverbs 3:5-6
		  `Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.`
		- Jeremiah 17:9
		  `The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?`
		- 1 Corinthians 10:13 (second half)
		  `....he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.`
	- these verses guide my faith and my actions
		- (or i guess you could say my faith in action hahaha)
- why not earlier?
	- i had a warped perception of baptism
		- guilt, shame and not being good enough
		- thinking i wasnt ready
	- commitment and avoidant issues
		- uh lets not talk about this in too much detail :P

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- what changed?
	- met different people that changed my perception of baptism 
		- (some who are strangers!)
		- dwelled on the fact that i have already been forgiven
	- i started taking my life more seriously
		- helped me realise the extent of my imperfection 
		  (and that i need God in my life)
		- opened my eyes to the vastness of Gods grace (praise <3)
		  (and that i WANT God in my life)
		- also linked to the significance and grandness of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross 
		  (and that he DESERVES my declaration as his follower)
- whats next?
	- follow Gods calling for me to be a "minister of hearts" (prophesied by a stranger, he even prayed for me <3)
		- continue to better myself so i can be prepared to guide and minister others in their faith
	- continue to make effort in LIVING OUT Gods word
		- read the word more
		- pray when tempted or faced with difficulty
